# Hadoop 

In the following I have followed the following tutorial on LinkedIn Learning: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-hadoop-2/ . In this repository you may find the work I have done through this course and below are the notes from the tutorial. I have installed Hadoop using the Apache binaries and configured it on windows. The following is a screenshot of http://localhost:9870/ that appears when I run : start-yarn.cmd and hdfs-start.cmd in the command prompt under the \sbin directory of the Hadoop binary files.

# Notes

Hadoop uses HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File Systems). HBase is a NoSQL database.
